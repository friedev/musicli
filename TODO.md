# TODO

- Refactoring
	- Save all messages including control changes (e.g. volume) as non-note events in the song (separate track, uneditable for now)
- Editing
	- Select all notes in a time range (visual mode); one track by default, Shift for all tracks
	- Delete/cut/copy/paste selected notes
	- Transpose (just vertical movement)
	- Undo/redo stack (general Result class with the ability to apply an undo, or just note undo/redo with a simpler class to add/remove/replace)
	- Record macro(s) (just a list of actions)
	- Set and jump to mark(s)
	- Chord insert mode: when a key is pressed, its natural chord in the current key/scale is inserted
	- Word (chord) motion: jump to next chord regardless of distance, end of chord, start of previous chord
	- Change a note/chord (delete and enter insert mode)
	- Overwrite notes while inserting (replace mode)
	- Merge one channel into another (need some way to choose or reorder tracks)
	- Jump to measure number by typing the number and another key
	- Prefix actions with a number to repeat them
- Instruments
	- Focus on specific instrument (hide and mute others)
	- Display drum names on sidebar when editing drums
	- Separate drum window with a custom set of drums to use?
	- Color notes based on their instrument's category (piano, brass, etc.)
- In-editor functionality
	- Change song properties (e.g. tempo, cols per beat, etc.)
	- Save to interactively specified file
	- Open interactively specified file
	- Change channel properties (volume, color)
- Music theory
	- Basic chord identification in format_notes
	- Better sharp/flat determination based on scale
- Visualizer mode (command line argument): just play the song with no editing features and exit when done
- MIDI port I/O
- Real-time note durations in insert mode (recording mode)
- Mouse support (if possible)
- Documentation
