# TODO

- Refactoring
	- Save all messages including control changes (e.g. volume) as non-note events in the song (separate track, uneditable for now)
- Editing
	- Select all notes in a time range (visual mode)
	- Delete/cut/copy/paste selected notes
	- Transpose
	- Undo/redo stack
	- Keybind to sync playhead to cursor and vice versa
	- Basic chord identification in format_notes
	- Chord insert mode: when a key is pressed, its natural chord in the current key/scale is inserted
- Instruments
	- Focus on specific instrument (hide and mute others)
	- Display drum names on sidebar when editing drums
	- Separate drum window with a custom set of drums to use?
	- Color notes based on their instrument's category (piano, brass, etc.)
- In-editor functionality
	- Change song properties (e.g. tempo, cols per beat, etc.)
	- Save to interactively specified file
	- Open interactively specified file 
- Track notes currently being played, and stop them when playback is paused
- Better sharp/flat determination based on scale
- MIDI port I/O
- Mouse support (if possible)
- Documentation
- Remove strict dependencies, allow partial functionality in their absence
