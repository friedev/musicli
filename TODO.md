- Save all messages including control changes (e.g. volume) as non-note events in the song (uneditable for now)
- Select notes by instrument (useful for track exporting too)
- Prompt/menu to select instrument
- Focus on specific instrument (hide and mute others)
- Note labels for drums
- Inserting rests with / (?)
- Set note velocity, preserve for subsequent notes
- Select notes/chords under the cursor (keybind or automatic)
- Measure select and delete/cut/copy/paste
- Transposition
- Undo/redo stack
- Stack of previous notes for backspacing, or automatic selection
- Keybind to sync playhead to cursor and vice versa
- View details in normal mode
- MIDI port I/O
- Mouse support (if possible)
- Documentation
- Screenshot(s)
- Remove strict dependencies, allow partial functionality in their absence
