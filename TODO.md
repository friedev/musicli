# TODO

- Refactoring
	- Refactor Song.tracks as a dict mapping from channel to Track
- MIDI support
	- Save all messages including control changes (e.g. volume) as non-note events in the song (separate track, uneditable for now)
	- Handle additional messages
		- time_signature (MetaMessage)
		- key_signature (MetaMessage)
		- track_name (MetaMessage)
		- pitchwheel (Message, pyfluidsynth.pitch_bend)
		- control_change (Message, pyfluidsynth.cc)
			- Also generalize volume as a CC
- Modal editing
	- Select all notes in a time range (visual mode); one track by default, Shift for all tracks
	- Delete/cut/copy/paste selected notes
	- Transpose (just vertical movement)
	- Undo/redo stack (general Result class with the ability to apply an undo, or just note undo/redo with a simpler class to add/remove/replace)
	- Record macro(s) (just a list of actions)
	- Set and jump to mark(s)
	- Chord insert mode: when a key is pressed, its natural chord in the current key/scale is inserted
	- Word (chord) motion: jump to next chord regardless of distance, end of chord, start of previous chord
	- Change a note/chord (delete and enter insert mode)
	- Overwrite notes while inserting (replace mode)
	- Jump to measure number by typing the number and another key
	- Switch to instrument by typing the number and another key
	- Repeat last action
	- Real-time note durations in insert mode (recording mode that triggers raw mode in curses)
	- Track last inserted semitones to support repeating
- Editor capabilities
	- Change song properties (e.g. tempo, cols per beat, etc.)
	- Save to interactively specified file
	- Open interactively specified file
	- Change channel properties (volume, color)
	- View/create/delete CC messages
- View
	- Toggle view between note names and velocities
	- Color notes based on their instrument's category (piano, brass, etc.)
	- High-level song overview that shows when different tracks are active
	- Pattern editor mode (drums, bass, etc.)
- Audio backends
	- SFZ

	- Waveform synthesis
		- https://github.com/yuma-m/synthesizer
		- https://github.com/luvsound/pippi
		- https://github.com/zacharydenton/wavebender
		- https://github.com/irmen/synthesizer
		- https://mdoege.github.io/PySynth/
	- WAV export
		- https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html
		- https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/docs/
- MIDI port I/O
- Visualizer mode (command line argument): just play the song with no editing features and exit when done
- Add fake backends (curses and fluidsynth) via Interface and Player flags (this would allow for unit testing and profiling)
- Mouse support (if possible)
- Code documentation
